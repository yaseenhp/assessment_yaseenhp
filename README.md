## Python Assessment

#### The Python assessment code is structured into two separate files for enhanced readability and modularity:

**`assessment_functions.py`**: This module contains all the necessary functions required to complete the seven tasks outlined in the assessment. Each function is designed to handle a specific task, ensuring the code remains organized and easy to maintain.

**`assessment-python-1.py`**: This file serves as the main script that calls the relevant functions from `assessment_functions.py` and displays the output for each task. It acts as the execution layer, providing a clear flow for performing and showcasing the results of the assessment.

In my usual workflow, I include thorough unit tests and robust exception handling to ensure production code quality. However, to simplify this assessment, I have implemented only minimal exception handling. To run the assessment example please following the steps below :

### Step 1 : Clone the code

        git clone https://github.com/yaseenhp/assessment_yaseenhp.git

#### and change directory to `assessment_yaseenhp`

        cd assessment_yaseenhp

### Step 2 : Prepare the environment and install dependent packages

#### Setup virtual environment \*

        python -m venv venv

#### Activate virtual environment [Windows]

        .\venv\Scripts\activate

#### Activate virtual environment [Mac/Linux]

        source venv/bin/activate

### Step 3 : Install requirements

        pip install -r requirements.txt

### Step 4 : Run the code and once the data is loaded. The system will prompt to press Enter key to proceed.\*

        python assessment-python-1.py

##### \* For Python versions 3.x, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python` when running commands, particularly on systems where both Python 2.x and Python 3.x are installed.

## SQL Assessment
